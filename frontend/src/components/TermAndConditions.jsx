                    Welcome to AalimGPT, a chatbot service that provides Islamic Scholar advice based on Quran, Sunnah, and Fiqh. These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of our service, so please read them carefully. By using our service, you agree to these Terms.

                    <h4>Service description</h4>
                    Our service provides a chatbot that can answer questions related to Islamic Scholar advice. Our chatbot is based on a machine learning model that has been trained on a dataset of Quran, Sunnah, and Fiqh. Our service is free, but we require donations to keep the service running. We also require users to sign up and provide some personal information, including email address, religious affiliation, and location. We keep a record of all the chats that happen on our platform and human Islamic scholars look through the chats that are marked as not correct and provide corrected answers. This dataset is further used to fine-tune the model. We do not sell this data to any third party or expose user information to any 3rd party.
